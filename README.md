# Guest price calculator
this repo usually just random shit i make to learn languages.
this project will calculate the price of the ticket the guest will have to pay, the hall hold's only a 100 people so entering a higher number will be calculated at 100 and most importantly notify the user, and a discount is added for booking larger than a 50 guests, uses bunch of methods and shows how to implement them from another class in Java.
